# Introduction to the Virtual Kubelet

The open source Virtual Kubelet project provides an alternative implementation of the kubelet, which adds a virtual node to your Kubernetes cluster. This virtual node can be backed by a variety of providers, including serverless container infrastructure like Azure Container Instances and AWS Fargate. 

In this workshop, we'll explore how the virtual kubelet works and how to install it in your Kubernetes cluster. Then we'll look at providers and the different scenarios that can be supported.
